Proxy API Routes <a href='https://github.com/ElishaKay/social-king/tree/master/Proxy/server/proxy-routes'>are defined here</a>.

The Proxy API Controller Functions are <a href='https://github.com/ElishaKay/social-king/tree/master/Proxy/server/proxy-controllers'>defined here</a>.

<h3>Importing Controller Functions into Route Files</h3>

Controller functions are imported and injected into the routes files like so (Example from <a href='https://github.com/ElishaKay/social-king/blob/master/Proxy/server/proxy-routes/blog.js'>Proxy/routes/proxy-routes/blog.js</a>:
):

```javascript
const {
    create,
    list,
    listForSitemap,
    listAllBlogsCategoriesTags,
    read,
    remove,
    listByUser
} = require('../proxy-controllers/blog');
```

<h3>When an HTTP Request Hits The Server</h3>

Here's another exampe from that same route file mentioned above, <a href='https://github.com/ElishaKay/social-king/blob/master/Proxy/server/proxy-routes/blog.js'>Proxy/routes/proxy-routes/blog.js</a>:

```javascript
router.post('/user/blog', requireSignin, authMiddleware, create);
```

That means, when a Post request is made to '/proxy/blog', the Req, Res, and Next objects are passed to the <em>requireSignin, adminMiddleware, and create</em> in sequential order.

<h3>The Req, Res, and Next() Conveyor belt</h3>

The <em>Req</em> object contains all the functionality required for handling a request.
The <em>Res</em> object contains all the functionality required for sending back a response.
The <em>Next</em> function contains all the functionality required for sending <em>Req & Res</em> into the next function in the Conveyor Belt.

The easiest way to think of these 3 objects is as if they are going through a Manufacturing Conveyor Belt. Each function (also called: 'middleware') has the ability to tack new fields unto these objects.

For example, <a href='https://github.com/ElishaKay/social-king/blob/master/Proxy/server/proxy-controllers/auth.js'>in the authMiddleware function</a>, we grab the email from the POST query string, search the database for that user, and then tack the user object unto the Req object, like so:

```javascript
exports.authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
    // grab the email from the POST query string
    let email = req.query.email.toLowerCase();
    ... 
    // search the database for the user with the given email
    User.findOne({ email: email }).exec((err, user) => {
    ...
    //tack the user object unto the Req object so that the user object can be accessed by the next middleware functions down the chain 
    req.user = user;
    ...
    // Pass the req, res, and next() objects into the next function in the chain
    next();
```

The benefit of this is that when we get to the next function in the chain, the <a href='https://github.com/ElishaKay/social-king/blob/master/Proxy/server/proxy-controllers/blog.js'>blog<em>Create</em> function</a>, we can use the user object we got the previous middleware function, like so:

```javascript
blog.postedBy = req.user._id;
```
